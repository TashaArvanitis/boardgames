    <h3><a href="/">Apps home</a></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I've been playing tons of amazing games with family and friends
    during this time of plague. Here are my favorites (so far).</p>

    <p>NOTE: using things for free on the internet is all fun and games
    until it means game designers and programmers aren't getting fairly
    compensated for their work. I recommend:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Own these games in hard copy. This means you're
            paying the designer a fair price. But it still doesn't thank
            the people who implement the game somewhere on a website.</li>
        <li>Pay or donate to the web developers who put your favorite games
            online. Even just a $5-10 contribution helps.</li>
        <li>In addition to (1) and/or (2), send designers a thank you
            email! They'll certainly appreciate it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Games!</h2>
    <ol>
    {% for game in played_games %}
    <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ game.url }}">{{ game.game }}</a> ({{ game.min_players }}
        - {{ game.max_players }} players)<br>
        {% autoescape off %}
            <small>{{ game.notes }}
        {% endautoescape %}
        {% if game.donation_url %}
        <br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ game.donation_url }}">Donation
                link</a>
        {% endif %}
        </small>
       </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ol>

    <h3>What game should we play?</h3>

    <p>Party games: skribbl.io, Scattergories</p>

    <p>Social intrigue games: Secret Hitler and Avalon</p>

    <p>Older family members: Bridge is always a winner with my oma!</p>

    <p>Good for just two or three people: Splendor</p>
