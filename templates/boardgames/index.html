    <p>I've been playing tons of amazing games with family and friends
    during this time of plague. It's gotten hard to keep track of what's
    where! So here's my favorites (so far). See below the list for advice
    on what game might be best for your situation.</p>

    <p>NOTE: using things for free on the internet is all fun and games
    until it means game designers and programmers aren't getting fairly
    compensated for their work. I recommend:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Owning these games before playing them online â€“ this option is
            like bringing the physical game to a party. It means you're
            paying the designer a fair price. But it still doesn't thank
            the people who implement the game somewhere on a website.</li>
        <li>Tip, donate, or buy a coffee for the web developers who put
            your favorite games online. Even just a $5-10 contribution
            helps.</li>
        <li>In addition to (1) and/or (2), send designers a thank you
            email! They'll certainly appreciate it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Games!</h2>
    <ol>
    {% for game in played_games %}
    <li><a href="{{ game.url }}">{{ game.game }}</a> ({{ game.min_players }}
        - {{ game.max_players }} players)<br>
        <small>{{ game.notes }}
        {% if game.donation_url %}
        <br><a href="{{ game.donation_url }}">Donation
                link</a>
        {% endif %}
        </small>
       </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ol>
    <hr/>

    <h2>But what game should I play??</h2>

    <p>Party games: skribbl.io, Scattergories</p>

    <p>Social intrigue games: Secret Hitler and Avalon</p>

    <p>Older family members: Bridge is always a winner with my grandma! </p>

    <p>Good for just two or three people: Splendor</p>

    <h2>(Games I'd like to play someday)</h2>

    <ol>
    {% for game in unplayed_games %}
    <li><a href="{{ game.url }}">{{ game.game }}</a> ({{ game.min_players }}
        - {{ game.max_players }} players)<br>
        <small>{{ game.notes }}
        {% if game.donation_url %}
        <br><a href="{{ game.donation_url }}">Donation
                link</a>
        {% endif %}
        </small>
       </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ol>
